Thanks for providing the opportunity.
Here, I have created an ASP.NET Core MVC app to list, add, edit and delete customer records. I have used In-Memory Database to store the records. 
The records in In-Memory database are accessed using APIs. The APIs can be accessed/testing using swagger with the following link - https://localhost:7027
Please note that I have just added basic validation using Data Annotation Validators.
